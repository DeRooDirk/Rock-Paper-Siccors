## Js Challenge

### Must-have features: phase 1

Have three buttons that the player can press to pick their weapon of choice (feel free to use emoji's for this)
Have a play button to have the computer pick one randomly
Announce the winner
No alert box, add a message to your html
Possible outcomes: draw (when both chose the same thing) or player won/lost
If you come across a topic that you don't know much about, feel free to research it (or ask well formatted questions to your peers or coach) - but look for info specifically to that topic. Spending half an hour re-checking how function work is fine, listening all day to "building a todo app with JS" is not.

Step by step guidance (up to you if you want it)
Must-have features: phase 2
Show a play again button after a game ended
Nice graphics
Different end message styling depending on the outcome (hint: you might need to add or remove classes via JavaScript for this)
If you want, you can add a fun factor by changing the three choices
Clean your code
Delete unused code or out of date comments
Try to write hard to understand parts in a way that's easier to understand for other developers
Can you use functions to make your code easier to read or reuse?
Nice-to-have features
Keep track of the score after multiple games
Show what the player picked by highlighting the correct button
